The <b>Spore %ModAPI SDK</b> allows you to create C++ mods into Spore. These mods are compiled into <tt>.dll</tt> files,
that can then be used by the <b>ModAPI Launcher</b> (https://sporemodder.wordpress.com/spore-modapi/) to inject them into Spore.

Download the latest release from https://github.com/Emd4600/Spore-ModAPI/releases/latest
