This GitHub page hosts the Spore ModAPI development kit, used to create Spore mods with C++. 
To use those mods, you need the [ModAPI Launcher and Installers](http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/).
The documentation of the SDK is available here: http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/emd4600/SporeModAPI/index.html

The <b>Spore %ModAPI SDK</b> allows you to create C++ mods for Spore. These mods are compiled into <tt>.dll</tt> files,
that can then be used by the <b>[%ModAPI Launcher Kit](http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/index.html)</b> to inject them into Spore.

The documentation of the SDK is available here: http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/emd4600/SporeModAPI/index.html

Instructions about download, installation and updating can be found [in this tutorial](_installation.md).

The source code can be found in this GitHub repository. It also includes the source code
of 3 real mods made with the %ModAPI SDK:
